# Attendance-system-using-mtcnn-and-facenet-and-anti-cheating-with-yolov8-and-spoof
Real-time face recognition attendance system using MTCNN, FaceNet, and YOLOv8, integrated with anti-spoofing to prevent cheating. Designed for educational environments with high accuracy and fraud detection capabilities.

A deep learning–based attendance system built for real-time classroom environments.  
Uses MTCNN for face detection, FaceNet + SVM for recognition, YOLOv8 to detect phones (fraud), and anti-spoofing model to prevent fake face attacks.  
Designed to run at 30+ FPS with high accuracy using personal dataset.

This project was developed as a team capstone project at FPT University (Spring 2025).
